# Instructions to Add Project to GitHub

This document provides step-by-step instructions to initialize a git repository for your project and push it to GitHub.

## Prerequisites

1. Git must be installed on your system
2. You must have a GitHub account
3. You should have configured git with your GitHub credentials

## Steps

### 1. Initialize the Git Repository

Open a terminal in the project root directory and run:

```bash
git init
```

### 2. Add All Files and Make Initial Commit

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

### 3. Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Enter "testsuite" as the repository name
3. Select "Public" for visibility
4. Leave all other options unchecked (don't initialize with README, .gitignore, or license)
5. Click "Create repository"

### 4. Add the Remote and Push

After creating the repository on GitHub, you'll see instructions for pushing an existing repository. It will look something like this (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username):

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/testsuite.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Make sure you're in the correct directory when running git commands
2. Ensure you have internet connectivity
3. Verify your GitHub credentials are correctly configured
4. Check that the repository name matches exactly

## Additional Notes

- The `.gitignore` file has been created in the root directory to exclude unnecessary files from the repository
- The project structure includes client, server, and shared components all in one repository
- Database files (like `server/testsuite.db`) are excluded from the repository for security and portability reasons
